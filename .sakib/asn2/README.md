`hebb_snn.py` contains my implementation
of Hebbian Learning with firing-rate encoding.

`stdp_snn.py` contains my implementation
of Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity learning
with temporal time-to-first-spike encoding.

`tempo.py` contains my implementation of the
Tempotron which uses temporal time-to-first-spike
encoding to classify images of 5x5 grids of lines.

`lines/` contains my input images of 5x5 grids
of lines which are fed into the tempotron.

`graphs/` contains my output graphs from the
execution of the tempotron on the input data.

`neurons.py` contains my implementation of
the LIF (Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire) neuron.
